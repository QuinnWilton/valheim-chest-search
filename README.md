A Valheim Mod that enables you to search for items in nearby containers.

## Usage

While ingame, you can search nearby chests for items using the following chat command:

```
/search <query>
```

Any chests with matching contents will be highlighted.

For example, if you type `/search wood`, any chests containing an item with `wood` in their name will be highlighted.
